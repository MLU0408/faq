## Answer

The obligation to issue receipts to the customer (ยง 146a Abs. 2 AO) is a legal requirement which must be fulfilled by the POS system itself.

The process of printing and handing out receipts is not part of the fiskaltrust compliance. We assume that once the order is beeing processed and the receipt is send to fiskaltrust.Middleware, the receipt is being handed out as required. Therefore there is no requirement to log that issue into our journal by the fiskaltrust.Middleware. 

We recommend to try to reprint, once pos is ready.
