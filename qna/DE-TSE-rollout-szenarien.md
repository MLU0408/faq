## Answer

It is possible to operate more than one cash register with a TSE. There are some prerequisites and it is highly dependend on the pos-system, therefore there is no common answer to that question.

We recommend to have a look on our [guideline for rollout scenarios](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/doc/productdescription-de-doc/for-posdealers/02-pre-sales/rollout-scenarios.html) to assess all options and to find a solution which fits to your requirements.
